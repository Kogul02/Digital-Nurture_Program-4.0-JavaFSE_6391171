Explain React Events

In React, events are how you handle user interactions like clicks, key presses, form submissions, etc.
React wraps the browser's native events with its own event system called Synthetic Events for better performance and cross-browser compatibility.

React events are similar to DOM events but follow a different syntax and use camelCase.

Explain About Event Handlers

Event handlers are functions that are triggered in response to an event. In React, you pass these handler functions as props to elements
function MyButton() {
  function handleClick() {
    alert('Button clicked!');
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
}
In the above example, onClick={handleClick} assigns the event handler to the button. When the button is clicked, handleClick() is executed.

Define Synthetic Event

A SyntheticEvent is a wrapper around the browserâ€™s native event system in React.
It provides a consistent interface for all browsers and includes all the same properties and methods as the native event.

React uses the SyntheticEvent system to improve performance via event delegation and to normalize events across browsers.

Identify React Event Naming Convention

React uses camelCase for event names, unlike HTML which uses lowercase.

HTML Event	React Event
onclick		onClick
onchange	onChange
onkeydown	onKeyDown

Also, in React, event handlers are passed as functions (not strings like in HTML).
