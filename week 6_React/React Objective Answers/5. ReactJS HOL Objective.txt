 1. Need for Styling React Components:
Makes UI visually appealing and consistent

Helps in separating layout from logic

Ensures components are reusable and clean

Prevents style conflicts in large apps

2. CSS Modules:
Styles scoped to the component (no global conflicts)

File uses .module.css extension

Import as an object and apply class like:

jsx
className={styles.className}
 Inline Styles:
Written directly in JSX using a style prop

Uses JavaScript object with camelCase keys

jsx

style={{ backgroundColor: 'blue' }}
