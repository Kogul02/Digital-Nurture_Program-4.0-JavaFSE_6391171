1. Explain React Components:
React components are the building blocks of a React application. Each component represents a part of the UI and can be reused throughout the app. Components manage their own structure, styling, and behavior.

They can be class-based or function-based.

They can receive inputs as props and return UI elements.

2. Differences Between Components and JavaScript Functions:

A React component is designed to return JSX, which is the UI structure rendered in the browser, while a JavaScript function is a general-purpose block of code that performs a task or returns any type of data.

React components receive props as input, which are similar to parameters in regular functions. However, props are specifically meant for passing data into components.

When it comes to the return value, a React component returns JSX (or null), whereas a JavaScript function can return any value like strings, numbers, objects, or even another function.

React components, especially class components, support lifecycle methods like componentDidMount() that run at specific stages of the component's life. JavaScript functions do not have any built-in lifecycle behavior.

Lastly, function components in React can use Hooks (like useState and useEffect) to manage state and side effects. Regular JavaScript functions do not have access to React Hooks or lifecycle behavior.
3. Types of Components:
Class Components – Defined using ES6 classes, can use lifecycle methods.

Function Components – Simple functions that return JSX; can use Hooks.

Pure Components – Optimized class components that avoid unnecessary re-renders.

Higher-Order Components (HOC) – Functions that take a component and return a new component.

4. Class Component:
A class component is a React component defined using a JavaScript class that extends React.Component. It has access to lifecycle methods like componentDidMount() and componentDidUpdate().



class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
5. Function Component:
A function component is a simpler way to write components using JavaScript functions. Since React 16.8, Hooks allow function components to manage state and side effects.



function MyComponent(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
6. Component Constructor:
The constructor is a special method in class components used for:

Initializing state

Binding event handlers



constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = { count: 0 };
}
It’s required to call super(props) before using this.

7. render() Function:
The render() method is required in class components. It returns the JSX (UI) that will be displayed in the browser.



render() {
  return <div>Hello World</div>;
}
It must return a single parent element.

It is called every time the component updates.
